#' Check for co-existence of two activities
#'
#' The`and` rule checks whether two activities both occur in a case (or are both absent).
#' If activity A exists, Activity B should also exist, and vice versa.
#'
#' @param activity_a Activity A. A character vector of length one. This should be an activity of the event log supplied to  `check_rule`.
#' @param activity_b Activity B. A character vector of length one. This should be an activity of the event log supplied to  `check_rule`.
