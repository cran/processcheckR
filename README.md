processcheckR
=============

The goal of processcheckR is to support rule-based conformance checking. Currently the following declarative rules can be checked:

-   `contains`: activity occurs n times or more
-   `contains_exactly`: activity occurs exactly n times
-   `absent`: activity does not occur more than n - 1 times
-   `starts`: case starts with activity
-   `ends`: case ends with activity
-   `and`: two activities always exist together
-   `succession`: if activity A happens, B should happen after. If B happens, A should have happened before.
-   `response`: if activity A happens, B should happen after
-   `precedence`: if activity B happens, A should have happend before
-   `responded_existence`: if activity A happens, B should also (have) happen(ed) (i.e. before or after A)

Rules can be checked using the `check_rule` function (see example below). It will create a new logical variable to indicate for which cases the rule holds. The name of the variable can be configured using the `label` argument in `check_rule`.

Installation
------------

You can install processcheckR from github with:

``` r
