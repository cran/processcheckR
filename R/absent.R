#' Check if an activity is absent from a case
#'
#' The `absent` rule can be used to check whether an activity is absent in a case or not. The `n` parameter can be configured to create a different level of _absence_.
#' When n = 1, an activity is not allowed to occur even a single time. The maximum number of times it is allowed to occur is `n-1`.
#'
#'
#' @param activity The activity to check. Character vector of length one.
#' @param n n-1 is the allowed number of occurences of the activity. E.g. n = 1 means the activity should be absent, n = 2 means it is allowed to occur once.
