#' Check if activity is present (contained) in a case
#'
#' This rules examines whether the supplied activity is present in a case or not. The argument `n` can be used to set a minimum number of occurences that should be present in each case. Using the function `check_rule`, this information can be added to the event log.
#'
#' @param activity Activity to check. A character vector of length one. Should be an activity of the eventlog supplied with check_rule.
#' @param n The minimum number of times the activity should be present.
